Getting started
===============

This is where you describe how to get set up on a clean install, including the
commands necessary to get the raw data (using the `sync_data_from_s3` command,
for example), and then how to make the cleaned, final data sets.

1. Run the <notebook> in the folder `Folder name`. 
2. Download the scrypt.
